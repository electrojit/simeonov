\section{Intention of project}
The scope of this project is aimed to help understand and identify the advantages and/or disadvantages of the diverse modeling languages. \newline
In order to ensure meaningful assessment of the diverse modeling languages, a standardized software architecture need to be modeled, like the one offered by Automotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR).\newline
To insure meaningful result in industrial practice, the project activities should be comparable to the base practice (BP) defined by the Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination (SPICE) model.
\section{Goals and success criteria of project}
The project activities are going to be comparable to the base practices(BP) defined by the Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination(SPICE) model.
\begin{itemize}
\item BP1 - Software architectural design - 30.10.2009
\item BP2 - Software requirements - 06.11.2009
\item BP3 - Define interfaces - 20.11.2009
\item BP4 - Dynamic behavior - 27.11.2009
\item BP6 - Detailed design - 28.12.2009
\item BP7 - Verification criteria - 11.01.2010
\item BP8 - Verify Software design - 18.01.2010
\item BP9 - Consistency and Bilateral Traceability - 28.01.2010
\end{itemize}
The BP5 and BP10 cannot be done in this setting due to missing work products. The project is successfully completed if the results are meaningful in industrial practice.
